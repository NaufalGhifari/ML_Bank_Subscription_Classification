# Customer behavior prediction model using Random Forest
This repo aims to showcace the use of Random Forest Algorithms to predict whether or not a user will answer "Yes"/"No" in to a product subscription.

Datset Info:  
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. 

An end-to-end classification pipeline:
1. Dataset acquisition
2. Read and pre-process data
3. Feature engineering/encoding
4. Model training (Random Forest Algorithm)
5. Model deployment on a Streamlit app
